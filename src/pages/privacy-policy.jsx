            <div>Fair Information Practices</div>
            <div>
              The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
              privacy law in the United States, and the concepts they include
              have played a significant role in the development of data
              protection laws around the globe. In order to be in line with Fair
              Information Practices, we will take the following responsive
              action should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email
              within 7 business days. We also agree to the Individual Redress
              Principle, which requires that individuals have the right to
              legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and
              processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
              not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
              users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
              government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance
              by data processors.
