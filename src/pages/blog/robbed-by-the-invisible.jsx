        Ten years ago, I felt like my future had been stolen by something no one
        else could see.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a senior in high school, right at the peak of the pressure cooker.
        I was prepping for college auditions, carrying the typical stress of a
        teenager but with a singular, laser-focused goal: to become a
        professional dancer. I was ready to leave Las Vegas, to move out of
        state, and to prove to myself that I had what it took to make it in the
        real world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wasn't just a kid who took ballet once a week. I was operating at a
        high caliber. I started dancing when I was three years old and entered
        the competitive world at nine. I had the discipline, the drive, and the
        trajectory.
      </p>

      <p>
        But instead of an acceptance letter or a casting call, I got a different
        kind of life-changing news.
      </p>

      <h3>The Diagnosis</h3>

      <p>
        The diagnosis didn't happen overnight. I spent a distinct, agonizing
        year trying to find an answer. I went to five different neurologists in
        Las Vegas, only to be turned away time and time again. They told me it
        was just stress. They told me it was "all in my head."
      </p>

      <p>
        We finally fought for a referral to UCLA. After a year of gaslighting
        and confusion, I sat down with a neurologist named Dr. Ravin. Within 30
        minutes, she knew.
      </p>

      <strong>Paroxysmal Dyskinesia.</strong>

      <p>
        It is a rare disorder where my nervous system effectively has a mind of
        its own. It manifests as involuntary movements—sometimes slow, twisting,
        and sustained muscle contractions; other times brief, jerky,
        'dance-like' motions. To an outsider, it often looks like a seizure, yet
        I remain fully conscious throughout.
      </p>

      <p>
        These 'episodes' are driven by specific triggers. In the beginning, I
        endured 15 to 30 a day, lasting anywhere from seconds to hours. My
        primary triggers were emotional stress and physical exertion—at that
        time, even a simple walk was enough to set me off. Because we didn’t yet
        understand what was happening, the fear of the unknown fueled my stress,
        keeping me trapped in a perpetual cycle of involuntary pain.
      </p>

      <p>There was no stopping the episode; I simply had to wait it out.</p>

      <p>
        When she said the name, the relief in the room was breathtaking. I
        remember my mom asking Dr. Ravin for a hug at the end of the
        appointment. Finally, she felt hope for her daughter’s life.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as we left Los Angeles and the reality set in, the relief faded into
        grief. I realized there was no "cure" that would return me to my old
        life. I had to build a new normal around a body that felt like it had
        betrayed me.
      </p>

      <h3>The Identity Crisis</h3>

      <p>
        For the next few years, my relationship with my body felt like a
        one-sided conversation. I didn’t know how to bridge the gap or make it
        love me back; I was just left with the stinging sense of betrayal and
        disconnection from the skin I was in.
      </p>

      <p>
        My reality became a "pay to play" system. The cost of physical exertion
        was a total loss of control. My body would contort, and I’d be wiped out
        for days. I was robbed by the invisible.
      </p>

      <p>
        While my friends packed their bags and moved to the meccas of
        entertainment—New York, California—to chase their dreams, I stayed home.
        I watched from the sidelines while I was trying to figure out how to
        walk down the street without triggering an episode.
      </p>

      <p>
        I felt broken. I felt guilty, as if I had done something wrong—pushed
        too hard in rehearsal, slept too little—and was being punished for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I see that younger version of myself now: a defeated girl grasping for a
        dream that was no longer hers, trying to convince herself that
        everything happens for a reason. My entire sense of self was wrapped up
        in that one title, leaving me to ask:
        <strong>"If I am not a dancer, then who am I?"</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>The Search for Answers</h3>

      <p>
        I had to learn, out of necessity, how to master my own nervous system.
        For years, I lived with a pipeline of worries. Would I ever be able to
        dance again? Would I get to be independent? Could I have children one
        day?
      </p>

      <p>
        At the beginning of my diagnosis, I couldn't even walk down the street
        or get too emotional about something without risking an episode. That
        was my starting line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, I worked my way up. I built enough stamina to try
        everything—Muay Thai, swimming, pole dancing, cycling. I loved them, but
        they didn’t love me back. I was stuck in a cycle of pushing too hard,
        crashing, and recovering.
      </p>

      <p>Then, four years ago, I found Pilates.</p>

      <p>
        It was the first time I found a way to move consistently without
        "paying" for it later. It worked because it required a deep mind-body
        connection—that same "mind over matter" focus I had been practicing to
        manage my stress triggers. I was going to the studio 4–6 times a week. I
        felt like I had reclaimed something that had been stolen.
      </p>

      <h3>The Pivot</h3>

      <p>But even then, I hit a wall.</p>

      <p>
        I started developing a bad shoulder injury from overuse. I knew I wasn't
        engaging my core correctly; I was just "muscling through" the movements.
        When I reached out to the studio for a private lesson to learn the
        mechanics, they dismissed me. "Just take a 101 class," they said.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was disappointed. As a dance teacher myself, I know what it takes for
        an adult to carve out time to show up for a class. To be dismissed
        without a single question about <em>why</em> I was struggling felt like
        a door slamming shut.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        But in that moment, I felt a wind of determination. I realized: If I
        want to be safe, I have to understand the mechanics myself.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Why I Built Stance</h3>

      <p>
        I decided to get certified because I wanted to be the guide I never had.
        My goal became simple: to help people move safely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of my history, I developed a "hyper-awareness" of the body. When
        you come into Stance, I’m not just watching you move; I’m looking for
        the tension you hold subconsciously. I’m helping you find that split
        second where you stop fighting your body and start working <em>with</em>{" "}
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We might be listening to Fleetwood Mac, A Tribe Called Quest, or
        Paramore, but my goal is always the same: to help you find your limits
        safely, so we can eventually push past them.
      </p>

      <h3>My Reality Today</h3>

      <p>
        My life looks very different now than it did in those early, chaotic
        years.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am no longer at the mercy of my nervous system. Medication has quieted
        the storm, reducing my episodes from dozens a day to rare occurrences.
        I’ve developed a precise internal gauge; I can feel the 'aura' of an
        episode coming on—a specific tension creeping into my muscles that acts
        as a stop sign. I’ve swapped the high-octane rush of coffee for tea, and
        I use therapy to manage the mental load.
      </p>

      <p>I also have a partner who understands the rhythm of my life.</p>

      <p>
        I didn't meet my husband until years after my diagnosis, and I admit, I
        used to worry that a future partner would struggle to love a version of
        me that came with this much baggage. I feared I would be "too much."
      </p>

      <p>
        But he proves to me, over and over again, that I am not a burden. He
        knows that when I say 'I’m tired,' it’s time to quiet the house, take
        the dogs out, or hold the baby. And on those rare, extreme days where
        the episodes break through, he is the one walking me to the bathroom and
        helping me change my clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was tested most during the birth of our daughter. The epidural
        triggered a violent, two-hour episode where we could do nothing but
        wait. But he didn't panic. He sat right there, holding my hand during
        the split seconds where my body allowed me to rest.
      </p>

      <p>He taught me that I don't have to carry this alone.</p>

      <h3>The New Stage</h3>

      <p>
        Pilates didn't give me dance back—I fought for that myself. But Pilates
        gave me the structural safety to keep doing it. It is the tool I use to
        sustain my body so I can live the life I actually want.
      </p>

      <p>And that life is richer than the one I originally planned.</p>

      <p>
        Ten years ago, I thought my life was over because I lost the chance to
        perform for strangers in a stadium. Today, I realize I have a far more
        important audience. When I turn on the music in the kitchen and dance
        with my daughter. I am strong, I am present, and
        I am joyful.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also would have never imagined that I would be doing something like
        this—owning my own Pilates studio. Me, a small business owner? Who would
        have thought?
      </p>

      <p>
        I finally have the answer to that terrified question I asked myself all
        those years ago: <em>"If I am not a dancer, then who am I?"</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a mother. I am a survivor. I am a guide. And yes, in my own way, on
        my own terms—I am still a dancer.
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>
          If I could go back to that defeated young Teya, grasping at a life
          slipping through her fingers, I would tell her this: <br />
          <blockquote>
            "The storm will pass, and one day you will be brave enough to carve
            a path that is entirely your own."
          </blockquote>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you feel like your body has betrayed you, know that you don't have to
        just "manage" the decline. You get to discover what you are actually
        capable of.
      </p>

      <p>It’s time to take it back.</p>
